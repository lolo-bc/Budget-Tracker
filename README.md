# Budget Tracker

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. This simple application uses Webpack and Indexddb to create an app that you can download off the web and continue to use even without any kind of internet access. Buget Tracker is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that is a  cross-platform, no-download experience with all the benefits of a web app and a native app.
